# Playerguard, videogame bodyguard

Playerguard is an idea for a website that lists only games considerate of people's mental health.

To achieve this, there's 6 conditions an appropriate game meets..
1. no encouraging* physical violence (non optional violence only if non lethal and self defense)
2. no psychological horror nor physical horror
3. no pornified imagery nor sound
4. no gossip imagery nor sound (no fake negative events with real people)
5. no encouraging* alcohol nor other drugs
6. no encouraging* gambling (not for real money nor fake money)

\* not encouraging means that a player must always be given the option to choose not and not be punished for doing so
